        The Natural Language Processing group at Universitas Gadjah Mada,
        Indonesia, is a group of academics, researchers and students who are
        working on problems related to natural language understanding and
        generation. We are focusing on several topics including automatic
        essay/short answer scoring, fake news detection, authorship attribution,
        customer review analysis, speech recognition and also foundational
        topics in NLP. We are particularly interested in exploring NLP tasks
        especially for Bahasa Indonesia. However, our research are not limited
        to problems in Bahasa Indonesia but also can be extended to more broaden
        scope in other languages. Our current team are coming from diverse
        backgrounds; from NLP to big data, which make us capable to tackle
        problems from different point of views . We are open for collaboration!
